## Description
We have created a web application that lets users enter for their favorite artist. When user inputs in the search box the following will happen

* Recieve an image of the artist                ... ✔
* Recieve songs that the artist has             ... ✔
* Recieve lyrics to the song selected           ... ✔
* Recieve information of the artist             ...(In Progress)
* Recieve a link if the artist is on tour       ... ✔
* Recieve a Video on the selected song          ...(In Progress)


## Visuals
<!-- 
    Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method. -->

## Usage
<!-- 
    Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
