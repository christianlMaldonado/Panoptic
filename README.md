- Recieve lyrics to the song selected ... ✔
- Recieve information of the artist via wiki ... ✔
- Recieve a link if the artist is on tour ... ✔

## Usage

Enter an artist you can think of in the search bar. You will recieve information about the artist with songs that are popular by the atist and information about the artist via Wikipedia. Clicking on any of the songs will display song lyrics, if the song does not have any lyrics then it will display with an error. Alongside the lyrics a youtube video will pop up as well as a link to tour dates if the aritst has any upcoming tour dates.

Overall we belive that this is an easy to use application for any use to find the quickest information about an artist.
